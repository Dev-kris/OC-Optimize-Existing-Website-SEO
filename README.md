## Optimize an existing website for SEO, Performance, and Accessibility
 
### I have been tasked with preforming an audit of an existing portfolio page.

The area of focus is to identify potential improvements in semantic html, keyword usage, optimization for speed and accessibility. 

Since the site owner has chosen to target local businesses in Atlanta Georgia, Local (geographic) SEO optimization is important.

It is important to note that while the site's SEO score appears high, the lighthouse report does not go beyond very basic on-page SEO rules.

It is very possible to have a 100 score on actual SEO while is poorly optimized.

Upon auditing the original site many mistakes and Blackhat techniques were found. Notation of these can be found within the audit spreadsheet and the presentation. 

The most egregious offense was the use of hidden 1px "invisible" keywords. 

This practice is easily detectable and will result in negative ranking or outright removal from google results.

An example is provided below.
