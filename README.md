## Optimize an existing website for SEO, Performance, and Accessibility
 
### I have been tasked with preforming an audit of an existing portfolio page.

The area of focus is to identify potential improvements in semantic html, keyword usage, optimization for speed and accessibility. 
Since the site owner has chosen to target local businesses in Atlanta Georgia, Local (geographic) SEO optimization is important.

This is the summary of the lighthouse result before any optimization.

It is important to note that while the site's SEO score appears high, the lighthouse report does not go beyond very basic on-page SEO rules.
It is very possible to have a 100 score on SEO while still being poorly optimized. 

This is the full lighthouse report in PDF format before any optimization.  <a href="https://github.com/Dev-kris/OC-Optomize-Existing-Website-SEO/blob/main/site-audit/Lighthouse%20Report%20Before.pdf">:open_file_folder:</a>

_Upon completion of the audit, the optimized report will be visible here._
