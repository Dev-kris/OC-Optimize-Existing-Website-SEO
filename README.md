## Optimize an existing website for SEO, Performance, and Accessibility
 
### I have been tasked with preforming an audit of an existing portfolio page.

The area of focus is to identify potential improvements in semantic html, keyword usage, optimization for speed and accessibility. 
Since the site owner has chosen to target local businesses in Atlanta Georgia, Local (geographic) SEO optimization is important. 

This is the summary of the lighthouse result before any optimization.
